TODO (unordered)
- [x] Add basic sound
- [x] Start using server and networking (first step is just syncing paddle locations everywhere)
- [ ] Fix the color and sound selection disasters
- [ ] color paddles differently for each player
- [x] Add optional walls (so that you're not forced to always have 6 paddles)
- [ ] Keep track of points
- [ ] make more todos 
- [ ] Come up with a way for each client to send a unique heartbeat or something to keep track of number of active players
